                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p> 
                    Mastering pumpkin carving may seem challenging if approached from the intent to challenge your Facebook rival, who spent hours revising the original design with 1 to 3 drafts piled behind them. These people we call Facebook moms, and it's important not to get demotivated or feel bad for not being capable of delivering equal artistic abilities. Just remind yourself that they spend an entire day on a Facebook post. Thus, in this write-up, I'd like to take some stress off of you and explain the essentials in the art of pumpkin carving. 
                </p>

                <h4>Preperation</h4>
                <p>
                    Depending on the complexity of the face you're trying to carve, various tools may be more time-efficient for a simple example. A small sharp knife will be more than enough. Keep in mind that you will be removing the cavity, so things are guaranteed to get messy. Ensuring organization among your tools will be very time rewarding later on. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    After you have successfully removed the gooey cavity and set it aside, determine whether or not you need to use a stencil or not. Stencils are handy when trying to carve very detailed faces. Again, I recommend this source; this beginner-friendly guide will assume your look is easy enough for eyeballing when outlining.

                <h4>Carving</h4>
                <p> 
                    Before going Jason on your pumpkin, outlining your shape with a pencil on the pumpkin will allow for more precision and lead to a cleaner result. Now let's start slicing and dicing. Proceed to use that machete, I mean, a small sharp knife to pierce through a part of the outline that isn't on a corner; depending on the thickness of the pumpkin, using your knife as a saw may be an option. Remember to keep your fingers safe. After reaching a corner, pull your knife out and place it right through where the outline continues after the corner, and then proceed to cut towards your original line connecting both of them. Continue using this technique for the rest of the system. By chance, you're dealing with a circular shape, where you impale the circular outline endlessly until it all comes together into a harmonic circle. This technique can be referred to as the Calculus method.

                <h4>Closing</h4>
                <p>
                    Remember that this activity is intended for scary purposes, so accidental hideousness, in this case, will ultimately make your whole design even more difficult. But, on the other hand, adding in a candle on the big night will consistently score you extra points as it will only radiate more amazingness of your already fantastic design!
