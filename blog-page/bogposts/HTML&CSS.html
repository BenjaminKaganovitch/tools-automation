                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p> 
                    The construction of a website can be modelled using the human body. Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) are the bones that hold everything; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the skin and hair that make you look attractive. Both are important as your brand's sophistication. To the viewer, it will be entirely based on how it's visually perceived, and further functionality such as Python will rely on the elegance of its core structure. This is why in this entry, I'd like to go a bit in-depth in explaining both CSS and HTML and get you started with some basic concepts that you may want to use. 
                </p>

                <h4>Basic HTML</h4>
                <p>
                    As explained previously, HTML can be looked at as the structure where everything will sit. Like the human body, where there is the rib cage, skull, and pelvis, HTML contains different types of "bones" on which content will lay.  
                </p>

                <h4>Tag, Element and Attributes</h4>
                <p> 
                    There are the terms "HTML element" and "HTML tag" among web developers." The difference is that an HTML tag can be either an opening ("&#60;p&#62;") or a closing one ("&#60;/p&#62;"). In contrast, an HTML element can be referred to as the whole line of code, including its attributes. Attributes are the various parts within a component, besides the tags that will define different characteristics. For example, a commonly used attribute is using ids that link that element to further styling in CSS under that id, but more on that later.

                <h4>Inline vs Internal vs External</h4>

                <p> 
                    CSS is the aesthetic component to website design, unlike HTML that gravitates more to logical reasoning. Much like me, a couple of minutes ago, you may be wondering what in the world does cascading style sheets mean? Let me explain that CSS code can be found in any of the following three: In an external document that the original HTML page will connect to, internally located in the head portion of the paper, or inline with the actual HTML. The pencil that connects the dots is that the CSS will cascade over the internal code, much like the internal will cascade over the external. In other words, the closer the styling is to the HTML, the more priority it is given over the other CSS components.

                <h4>CSS General Tags</h4>
                <p>
                    Pro Tip:
                    If it ever occurs that you need to style a lot of similar elements, using a CSS selector will allow you to target all parts that share the same tag and style them simultaneously.
