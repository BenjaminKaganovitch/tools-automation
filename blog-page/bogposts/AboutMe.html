                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p> 
                    Born with a knack for invention where instead of collecting action figures, I enjoyed putting together recycles trying to replicate the Falcon 1 rocket ship. I shortly reached a limit to how creative my projects could be, being that all of my projects would operate on simple physical forces. Equipping myself with programming abilities gave me more means of exploring my engineering endeavours. Thus ultimately, my decision between Cybersecurity and Software Development was a no-brainer. 
                </p>

                <h4>Life/Passtion</h4>
                <p>
                    Having arithmetic-based school work all week makes you quite strained; therefore, introducing some skiing into my weekly routine was perfect but needed some adjustment. The desire to sometimes get out of your seat and do something active and having a dad who did skiing competitively in his youth engulfed me as well, at least in a hobbyist sort of way. Realizing Manitoba is a seasonal province led me to have to buy Roller Skis, an invention created for skiers who wish to continue training even without snow. Bison Grandin being my favourite trail to roller ski on, containing both a mix of steepness in slopes and cleanliness from pebbles.

                <h4>Space</h4>
                <p> 
                    I’ve always had an interest in space and recently have adopted a taste for finance, technology being the underlying substratum for each interest to prosper. One vocation I’ve considered pursuing was a combination of both astrophysics and computer science engineering, where I’d get to develop software for space companies to use. Having involuntarily watched the StarTrek franchise as a kid, my curiosity for space exploration established itself at a young age.
                </p>
                <h4>Business</h4>
                <p> 
                    After the 2021 Gamestop stock short squeezes, it seemed though every older generation Z member, including myself, had sparked interest in the stock market. In the endeavour to catch up, I began reading a couple of books and blogs on the matter but ineluctably fell into the void of the financial market. I joined an eCommerce startup from an organization known as CanU, whose intent is to teach students the basics of business, while simultaneously establishing an eCommerce.
